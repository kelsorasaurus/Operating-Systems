Operating System Functions
1. The operating system provides a user interface, which is how a person interacts with the operating system. GUI is a graphical user interface which means that a user points, clicks, or touches pictures or graphics that represent programs and files to interact with them. A command line interface is when a user needs to give a specific command to an operating system in order to interact with it, and has to enter the command at the command line. The command line interprets the input. 
2. Another operating system function is establishing an internet connection. An operating system usually provides a way for users to connect to the internet. A lot of operating systems provide web browsers, so that the users can connect immediately after gaining a connection. 
3. A final operating system function is managing programs. There are two types: single tasking and multitasking. Single tasking is when an operating system can only run one program at a time. Multitasking is when multiple programs can simultaneously.
